# Stock-Price-Analysis-and-Prediction
In this project, we focus on analyzing and predicting the stock price of Hoa Phat Group, one of the leading steel companies in Vietnam. The project consists of two main parts: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building a prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

# 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA phase, we perform various analyses and visualizations to better understand the trends and patterns in the stock price of Hoa Phat. Key activities include:

- Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Calculating basic metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and other parameters to assess the volatility of the stock price.
- Data Visualization: Utilizing time series plots to illustrate price fluctuations over time, and distribution charts to examine trends and factors affecting stock prices.
Correlation Analysis: Investigating the relationships between stock prices and macroeconomic factors or other financial indicators of the company.
# 2. Prediction Model with LSTM
After completing the EDA phase, we proceed to build a prediction model using LSTM. This type of neural network is well-suited for time series data, allowing us to capture long-term dependencies in the data. The implementation steps include:

- Data Preprocessing: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, and normalizing the data to enhance model performance.
- Building the LSTM Model: Setting up the LSTM network architecture with hidden layers and optimizing parameters to predict future stock prices.
- Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as RMSE and MAE to assess the model's performance and making adjustments to parameters as needed.
=> This project not only helps us gain insights into the stock price fluctuations of Hoa Phat Group but also provides a deeper understanding of applying deep learning techniques in the financial domain. The results from the prediction model will assist investors and stakeholders in making more informed investment decisions.
